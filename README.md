# **Progression and Challenge**
While playing this modpack, you'll experience a rewarding gameplay progression through the skill system and the improvement of armor and weapons, either via Zenith or standard dungeon looting. All of this comes with the constant challenge of increasingly difficult mobs and bosses, 
ensuring a fun and exciting experience at all times.

# **Lightweight philosophy**
The main goal behind creating this modpack was to make it as lightweight and easy to set up as possible. Unlike other modpacks that focus on sheer size, this one prioritizes performance and reliability while still offering engaging and enjoyable gameplay. The idea originally came from the need to make it work smoothly on a server, ensuring a stable and optimized experience for all players.

### **Reminder**
The modpack is still in it's _alpha_ phase, so there some things that are still WIP, like the patchouli quests and custom progression.
Please be patient with it.
